# Intro component with sign up form

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

## The project

In this project I built this **introductory component**

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly. The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*
